# Test
                              
```{r}
set.seed(123)
winners <- replicate(1e4, randtictactoe())
hist(winners, main = 'Results of 10,000 Tic-Tac-Toe Games')
```



# Notes
- We can check if 3 in a row by summing three entries and checking if they are 0 mod 3.
- Right now Player1 is coded as 1, Player2 is coded as 0, and a draw is -1. And I am using winner as an indicator if the game is finished. If not, then winner is NULL.
- For more state on a magic square: https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MagicSquare.html, we have to keep this in mind if we try to visualize any of the boards
